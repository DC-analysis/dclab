  - Data columns (including image, trace, contour) are accessed via
    keys instead of attributes.
  - Make space for new hdf5-based file format

    (new "_ancilliaries" attribute and "ancilliary_columns.py")

- Add filtering option "remove invalid events" to remove nan/inf
- Support nan and inf in data analysis
- Improve downsampling performance
- Refactor downsampling methods (#6)
0.2.2
- Add new histogram-based kernel density estimator (#2)
- Refactoring:

  - Simplify video export function (#4)
  - Removed "Plotting" configuration key
  - Removed .cfg configuration files
0.2.1
- Support npTDMS 0.9.0
- Add AVI-Export function
- Add lazy submodule for event trace data and rename `RTDC_DataSet.traces`
  to `RTDC_DataSet.trace`
- Add "Event index" column
0.2.0
- Compute sensible default configuration parameters for
  KDE estimation and contour plotting
- Speed-up handling of contour text files

0.1.7
- Added channel: distance between to first fl. peaks
- Added fluorescence channels: peak position, peak area, number of peaks
- Allow to disable KDE computation
- Add filter array for manual (user-defined) filtering
- Add config parameters for log axis scaling
- Add channels: bounding box x- and y-size
- Bugfixes:
  - cached.py did not handle `None`
  - Limiting number of events caused integer/bool error
0.1.6

- Bugfixes:
  - Correct determination of video file in RTDCDataSet
  - Fix multivariate KDE computation
  - Contour accuracy for Defo overridden by that of Circ
0.1.5

  https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/issues/43 
- Ignore empty columns in .tdms files (#1)
- Moved RTDC_DataSet and PolygonFilter classes to separate files

  - https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/issues/38
0.1.2
- Add support for limiting amount of data points analyzed
  with the configuration keyword "Limit Events"
- Comments refer to "events" instead of "points" from now on
