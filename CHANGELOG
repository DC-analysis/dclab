0.8.0
 - fix: usage of "xor" (^) instead of "or" (|) in statistics
 - feat: support `remove_invalid=False` in downsampling.downsample_rand (#27)
 - feat: add keyword arguments `xscale` and `yscale` to improve data
   visualization in `RTDCBase.get_downsampled_scatter`,
   `RTDCBase.get_kde_contour`, and `RTDCBase.get_kde_scatter` (#55) 
 - enh: make downsampling code more transparent
 - BREAKING CHANGE: low-level downsampling methods refactored
   - downsampling.downsample_grid: removed keyword argument
     `remove_invalid`, because setting it to `False` makes no sense
     in this context
   - downsampling.downsample_rand: changed default value of `remove_invalid`
     to `False`, because this is more objective
   - rename keyword argument `retidx` to `ret_idx`
   - these changes do not affect any other higher level functionalities
     in `dclab.rtdc_dataset` or in Shape-Out
