 - build: import new skimage submodules so that PyInstaller
   will find and use them
0.24.1
 - enh: improve polygon filter speed by roughly two orders of
   magnitude with a cython version taken from scikit-image; there
   are only minor differences to the old implementation (top right
   point included vs. lower left point included), so this is not
   a breaking change (#23)
0.24.0
 - data: refurbished LUT for linear elastic spheres provided by
   Dominic Mokbel and Lucas Wittwer (based on the FEM simulation
   results from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12155064.v2);
   compared to the old LUT, there is a relative error in Young's
   modulus below 0.1 %, which should not cause any breaking changes
 - data: updated isoelasticity lines (better spacing): analytical
   data was made available by Christoph Herold, numerical data
   was interpolated from the new LUT

 - enh: dclab-verify-dataset now also checks whether the sheath and
   sample flow rates add up to the channel flow rate
 - ref: Configuration does not anymore load unknown meta data
   keyword arguments, but ignores them. This implies that
   dclab-verify-dataset will not anymore check them actively.
   Instead, any warning issued when opening a file is added
   to the list of cues.

   - Allow contour data indices larger than uint8
0.2.5
 - Add ancillary columns "bright_avg" and "bright_sd" (#18, #19)
 - Standardize attributes of RTDCBase subclasses (#12)
 - Refactoring:
   - New column names and removal of redundant column identifiers (#16)
   - Minor improvements towards PEP8 (e.g. #15)

 - Bugfixes:
   - Hierarchy child computed all ancillary columns of parent upon
     checking availability of a column
0.2.4
 - Replace OpenCV with imageio

     (new "_ancilliaries" attribute and "ancilliary_columns.py")

 - Added fluorescence channels: peak position, peak area, number of peaks
 - Allow to disable KDE computation
 - Add filter array for manual (user-defined) filtering
 - Add config parameters for log axis scaling
 - Add channels: bounding box x- and y-size
 - Bugfixes:
   - cached.py did not handle `None`
   - Limiting number of events caused integer/bool error
0.1.6
 - Added `RTDC_DataSet.ExportTSV` for data export
 - Bugfixes:
   - Correct determination of video file in RTDCDataSet
   - Fix multivariate KDE computation
   - Contour accuracy for Defo overridden by that of Circ
