 - enh: improve polygon filter speed by roughly two orders of
   magnitude with a cython version taken from scikit-image; there

   Dominic Mokbel and Lucas Wittwer (based on the FEM simulation
   results from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12155064.v2);
   compared to the old LUT, there is a relative error in Young's

   data was made available by Christoph Herold, numerical data
   was interpolated from the new LUT

 - enh: dclab-verify-dataset now also checks whether the sheath and
   sample flow rates add up to the channel flow rate
 - ref: Configuration does not anymore load unknown meta data
   keyword arguments, but ignores them. This implies that
   dclab-verify-dataset will not anymore check them actively.
   Instead, any warning issued when opening a file is added
   to the list of cues.
