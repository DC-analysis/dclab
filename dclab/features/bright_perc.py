    The background-corrected event brightness is defined by the

    Parameters
    ----------
    mask: ndarray or list of ndarrays of shape (M,N) and dtype bool
        The mask values, True where the event is located in `image`.
    image: ndarray or list of ndarrays of shape (M,N)
        A 2D array that holds the image in form of grayscale values
        of an event.
    image_bg: ndarray or list of ndarrays of shape (M,N)
        A 2D array that holds the background image for the same event.

    Returns
    -------
    bright_perc_10: float or ndarray of size N
        10th percentile of brightness
    bright_perc_10: float or ndarray of size N
        90th percentile of brightness
