"""Computation of volume for RT-DC measurements based on a rotation
of the contours"""
import numpy as np


def get_volume(cont, pos_x, pos_y, pix):
    """Calculate the volume of a polygon revolved around an axis

    The volume estimation assumes rotational symmetry.
    Green`s theorem and the Gaussian divergence theorem allow to
    formulate the volume as a line integral.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cont: ndarray or list of ndarrays of shape (N,2)
        A 2D array that holds the contour of an event [px]
        e.g. obtained using `mm.contour` where  `mm` is an instance
        of `RTDCBase`. The first and second columns of `cont`
        correspond to the x- and y-coordinates of the contour.
    pos_x: float or ndarray of length N
        The x coordinate(s) of the centroid of the event(s) [µm]
        e.g. obtained using `mm.pos_x`
    pos_y: float or ndarray of length N
        The y coordinate(s) of the centroid of the event(s) [µm]
        e.g. obtained using `mm.pos_y`
    px_um: float
        The detector pixel size in µm.
        e.g. obtained using: `mm.config["imaging"]["pixel size"]`

    Returns
    -------
    volume: float or ndarray
        volume in um^3

    Notes
    -----
    The computation of the volume is based on a full rotation of the
    upper and the lower halves of the contour from which the
    average is then used.

    The volume is computed radially from the the center position
    given by (`pos_x`, `pos_y`). For sufficiently smooth contours,
    such as densely sampled ellipses, the center position does not
    play an important role. For contours that are given on a coarse
    grid, as is the case for RT-DC, the center position must be
    given.
