"""Computation of ancillary features

Ancillary features are computed on-the-fly in dclab if the
required data are available. The features are registered here
and are computed when `RTDCBase.__getitem__` is called with
the respective feature name. When `RTDCBase.__contains__` is
called with the feature name, then the feature is not yet
computed, but the prerequisites are evaluated:

.. ipython::
    :okwarning:

    In [1]: import dclab

    In [2]: ds = dclab.new_dataset("data/example.rtdc")

    In [4]: ds.config["calculation"]["emodulus lut"] = "LE-2D-FEM-19"

    In [3]: ds.config["calculation"]["emodulus medium"] = "CellCarrier"

    In [5]: ds.config["calculation"]["emodulus temperature"] = 23.0

    In [6]: "emodulus" in ds  # nothing is computed

    In [7]: ds["emodulus"] # now data is computed and cached

Once the data has been computed, `RTDCBase` caches it in
the `_ancillaries` property dict together with a hash
that is computed with `AncillaryFeature.hash`. The hash
is computed from the feature data `req_features` and the
configuration metadata `req_config`.

        ----------
        feature_name: str
            The name of the ancillary feature, e.g. "emodulus".
        method: callable
            The method that computes the feature. This method
            takes an instance of `RTDCBase` as argument.
        req_config: list
            Required configuration parameters to compute the feature,
            e.g. ["calculation", ["emodulus lut", "emodulus viscosity"]]
        req_features: list
            Required existing features in the dataset,
            e.g. ["area_cvx", "deform"]
        req_func: callable
            A function that takes an instance of `RTDCBase` as an
            argument and checks whether any other necessary criteria
            are met. By default, this is a lambda function that returns
            True. The function should return False if the necessary
            criteria are not met. This function may also return a
            hashable object (via :func:`dclab.util.objstr`) instead of
            True, if the criteria are subject to change. In this case,
            the return value is used for identifying the cached
            ancillary feature.

            .. versionchanged:: 0.27.0
                Support non-boolean return values for caching purposes.

        priority: int
            The priority of the feature; if there are multiple
            AncillaryFeature defined for the same feature_name,
            then the priority of the features defines which feature
            returns True in `self.is_available`. A higher value
            means a higher priority.
        data: object
            Any other data relevant for the feature (e.g. the ML
            model for computing 'ml_score_xxx' features)

        Notes
        -----
