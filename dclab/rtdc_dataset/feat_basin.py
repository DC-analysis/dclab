        location: str
            Location of the basin, this can be a path or a URL, depending

        name: str
            Human-readable name of the basin
        description: str
            Lengthy description of the basin
        features: list of str
            List of features this basin provides; This list is enforced,
            even if the basin actually contains more features.
        measurement_identifier: str
            A measurement identifier against which to check the basin.
            If this is set to None (default), there is no certainty
            that the downstream dataset is from the same measurement.

            Which type of mapping to use. This can be either "same"
            when the event list of the basin is identical to that
            of the dataset defining the basin, or one of the "basinmap"

           dataset contains fewer events than the downstream dataset,
