    Temporary features are custom features that can be defined ad hoc

    features are not enough, e.g. for prototyping, testing, or
    collating with other data. Temporary features allow you to
    leverage the full functionality of :class:`RTDCBase` with
    your custom features (no need to go for a custom `pandas.Dataframe`).

    ----------

        digits, and underscores
    label: str
