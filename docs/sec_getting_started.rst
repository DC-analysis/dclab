Getting started

Installation
============

To install dclab, use one of the following methods:
    
* from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dclab>`_:
    ``pip install dclab[all]``
* from `sources <https://github.com/DC-analysis/dclab>`_:
    ``pip install .[all]``

The extra key ``[all]`` installs all possible dependencies in any
context of RT-DC data analysis. You might prefer to only install
a subset of these:

- ``pip install dclab``: for the basic dclab functionalities
- ``pip install dclab[dcor]``: to :ref:`access online data <sec_av_dcor>` from `DCOR <https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de/>`_
- ``pip install dclab[export]``: for .avi and .fcs export
- ``pip install dclab[lme4]``: for :ref:`linear mixed effects model analysis <sec_av_lme4>` using `R/lme4 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html>`_
- ``pip install dclab[s3]``: for accessing .rtdc (HDF5) data on S3-compatible storage
- ``pip install dclab[tdms]``: for the (outdated) .tdms file format

You may also combine these dependencies, i.e. ``pip install dclab[dcor,s3]``
for DCOR and S3 support.

In addition, dclab already comes with code from `OpenCV <https://opencv.org/>`_
(computation of moments) and `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`_
(computation of contours and points in polygons) to reduce the list of
dependencies (these libraries are not required to run dclab).

Note that if you are installing from source or if no binary wheel is
available for your platform and Python version, `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_
will be installed to build the required dclab extensions. If this process
fails, please request a binary wheel for your platform (e.g. Windows 64bit)
and Python version (e.g. 3.12) by creating a new
`issue <https://github.com/DC-analysis/dclab/issues>`_.


Use cases
=========
If you are a frequent user of RT-DC, you might run into problems that
cannot (yet) be addressed with the graphical user interface
`Shape-Out <https://github.com/ZellMechanik-Dresden/ShapeOut2>`_.
Here is a list of use cases that would motivate an installation of dclab.

- You would like to convert old .tdms-based datasets to the new .rtdc
  file format, because of enhanced speed in Shape-Out and reduced
  disk usage. What you are looking for is the command line program
  :ref:`sec_tdms2rtdc` that comes with dclab. It allows to batch-convert
  multiple measurements at a time. Note that you should keep the original
  .tdms files backed-up somewhere, because there might be future
  improvements or bug fixes from which you would like to benefit.
  Please note that `DCKit <https://github.com/DC-analysis/DCKit/>`_
  offers a graphical user interface for batch conversion from .tdms to .rtdc.
- You have built your own deformability cytometry device and would like to
  use the powers of dclab to analyze your data. There is user-convenient
  :class:`.RTDCWriter` class that allows you to convert your tabular data
  to *.rtdc* files.
- You would like to apply a simple set of filters (e.g. polygon filters that you
  exported from within Shape-Out) to every new measurement you take and
  apply a custom data analysis pipeline to the filtered data. This is a
  straight-forward Python coding problem with dclab. After reading the
  basic usage section below, please have a look at the
  :ref:`polygon filter reference <sec_ref_polygon_filter>`.
- You would like to do advanced statistics or combine your RT-DC
  analysis with other fancy approaches such as machine-learning.
  It would be too laborious to do the analysis in Shape-Out, export the
  data as text files, and then open them in your custom Python script.
  If your initial analysis step with Shape-Out only involves tasks
  that can be automated, why not use dclab from the beginning? 
- You simulated RT-DC data and plan to import them in Shape-Out
  for testing. Once you have loaded your data as a numpy array, you
  can instantiate an :class:`RTDC_Dict <dclab.rtdc_dataset.RTDC_Dict>`
  class and then use the :class:`Export <dclab.rtdc_dataset.export.Export>`
  class to create an .rtdc data file.

If you are still unsure about whether to use dclab or not, you might
want to look at the :ref:`example section <sec_examples>`. If you need
advice, do not hesitate to
`create an issue <https://github.com/DC-analysis/dclab/issues>`_.


Basic usage
===========
Experimental RT-DC datasets are always loaded with the
:func:`.new_dataset` method:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import dclab

    # .tdms file format
    ds = dclab.new_dataset("/path/to/measurement/Online/M1.tdms")
    # .rtdc file format
    ds = dclab.new_dataset("/path/to/measurement/M2.rtdc")
    # DCOR data
    ds = dclab.new_dataset("fb719fb2-bd9f-817a-7d70-f4002af916f0")


The object returned by :func:`.new_dataset` is always an instance of
:class:`.RTDCBase`. It enables read-only (!)
access to all features (e.g. "deform", "area_um") of the dataset. To show all
available features, use:

.. code-block:: python

    print(ds.features)

This will list all scalar features (e.g. "area_um" and "deform") and all
non-scalar features (e.g. "contour" and "image"). Scalar features can be
filtered by editing the configuration of ``ds`` and calling ``ds.apply_filter()``:

.. code-block:: python

    # register filtering operations
    amin, amax = ds["area_um"].min(), ds["area_um"].max()
    ds.config["filtering"]["area_um min"] = (amax + amin) / 2
    ds.config["filtering"]["area_um max"] = amax
    ds.apply_filter()  # this step is important!

This will update the binary, read-only array ``ds.filter.all`` which can be used to
extract the filtered data:

.. code-block:: python

    area_um_filtered = ds["area_um"][ds.filter.all]

It is also possible to create a hierarchy child of this dataset that
only contains the filtered data.

.. code-block:: python

    ds_child = dclab.new_dataset(ds)

The hierarchy child ``ds_child`` is dynamic, i.e. when the filters in ``ds``
change, then ``ds_child`` also changes after calling ``ds_child.rejuvenate()``.
Note that calling `rejuvenate` may be computationally expensive, so dclab
does not call it automatically. It is your own responsibility to call it
after updating the parent dataset.

Non-scalar features may not (depending on the file format) support fancy indexing (i.e.
``ds["image"][ds.filter.all]`` might not work. Use a for-loop to extract them.

.. code-block:: python

    for ii in range(len(ds)):
        image = ds["image"][ii]
        mask = ds["mask"][ii]
        # this is equivalent to ds["bright_avg"][ii]
        bright_avg = np.mean(image[mask])
        print("average brightness of event {}: {:.1f}".format(ii, bright_avg))

you might want to check out the :ref:`examples section <sec_examples>` and the
:ref:`advanced scripting section <sec_advanced_scripting>`.
